<p>Trees for Cities is a UK charity which aims to plant urban trees and create greener cities. Since 1993, the organisation has reported that 125,000 volunteers have planted over 1,000,000 urban trees in parks, streets, woodlands, schools, hospitals and housing estates. The charity also runs the Edible Playgrounds programme, which aims to inspire school children to grow and eat healthy food.</p>

<p>While working at EY, I joined my colleagues to help the organisation planting and maintaining the trees in Richmond Park and other green areas in the outskirts for London.</p>
<p>Please join us together, making the cities we live in greener, and making the world a better place!</p>
