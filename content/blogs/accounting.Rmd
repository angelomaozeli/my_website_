During my undergraduate period, I have obtained the ACCA affiliate membership by passing 13 exams in my spare time. I took the elective exams of Advanced Financial Management and Advanced Audit and Assurance.

After graduating from the undergraduate degree, I joined EY where I got the training under ICAS qualification. I completed 8 exams under ICAS qualification.

I also hold the student membership of ICAEW.

My accounting qualification and training laid a solid foundation for the finance studies in the future. I am familiar with IFRS and the accounting standards for UK and international reporting guidelines, as well as corresponding International Audit Standards.
